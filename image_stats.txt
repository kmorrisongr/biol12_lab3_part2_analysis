Image 20 - A LOT of cells in view, highest in the entire assignment.
Image 16 - We missed identifying one prophase here. The students misidentified the prometaphase.
Image 17 - The key says metaphase, but this looks like prometaphase, which is presumably what the students said. (Can check the enormous number of bar charts to confirm)
Image 37 - The key says metaphase, but this looks like prometaphase, which is presumably what the students said. (Can check the enormous number of bar charts to confirm)
Image 11 - This is a hard call to make. The key says telophase for this one - students who got it "wrong" said anaphase.
Image 14 - Actually just one in telophase, as cytokinesis hasn't completed. our mistake!
